## 📝 Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the Global Superstore dataset. The primary goal is to explore the sales data to identify key trends, top-performing products and categories, and regional sales performance. The insights derived from this analysis can help in making data-driven business decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives

- To clean and preprocess the raw data to make it suitable for analysis.
- To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends.
- To create insightful visualizations to present the findings.
- To provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis.
